By dividing an electrical signal into discrete pieces, pulse-width modulation (PWM) or pulse-duration modulation (PDM) is a technique for lowering the average power produced by an electrical signal. By rapidly flipping the switch between the supply and the load on and off, the average amount of voltage (and current) provided to the load is managed. The total power provided to the load increases while the switch is on for a longer period of time compared to when it is off. Depending on the load and application, the power supply's switching rate (or frequency) might change significantly.
